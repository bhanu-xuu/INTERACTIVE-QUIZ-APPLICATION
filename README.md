### 🎯 Interactive Quiz Application

This is a **Frontend Web Development** project built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The Interactive Quiz Application allows users to test their knowledge by answering multiple-choice questions in a clean, responsive interface. The quiz runs entirely in the browser without the use of any external libraries or frameworks, making it a great demonstration of fundamental web development skills.

## 📝 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a fully functional, browser-based quiz that dynamically loads questions and handles user input. It’s a beginner-to-intermediate level project aimed at practicing essential frontend concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, conditional logic, and basic responsive design.

The quiz displays one question at a time, lets users select from four options, and shows the final score at the end. Once completed, users can restart the quiz and try again.

## ✅ Features

- 📄 Displays one question at a time
- 🔘 Four answer options for each question
- ✔️ Allows user to select and submit an answer
- 🔄 Automatically moves to the next question upon submission
- 📊 Displays final score at the end of the quiz
- 🔁 Option to restart the quiz
- 🎨 Clean and responsive user interface
- 🚫 No external libraries — built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **HTML**: Defines the structure and layout of the quiz interface, including buttons, questions, and answer sections.
- **CSS**: Provides styling for the application — including layout, colors, spacing, hover effects, and responsiveness for different screen sizes.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the quiz functionality such as loading questions, tracking the current question, checking answers, updating the score, and rendering the result.

## 📚 Quiz Topics

The current quiz content focuses on **Andhra Pradesh**, covering topics such as:

- State capitals and cities
- Official language and classical dance forms
- Cultural landmarks and temples
- Important rivers and historical facts
- Government structure and proposed capitals

This makes the quiz both educational and localized, serving as a great example of thematic content delivery in frontend projects.
